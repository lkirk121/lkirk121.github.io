Time goes quickly! I can hardly believe its already Thanksgiving weekend. 

Last weekend the other high school teacher and I were invited to join one of the Indigenous language teachers out to her camp, a few hours west of Tsiigehtchic (along the Dempster Highway). I'll post pictures later today. 

This weekend, I've just been invited out fishing. It's snowing outside. I've been told to dress warm. I'll hopefully have some pictures to post later this afternoon. 

The snow is falling outside my window. In the bushes beside my apartment, the small rabbits that hop around there, have shed their summer fur, and are all white now.

I'll write more this afternoon!

PS. I'm doing my best to get a post up each Saturday.
