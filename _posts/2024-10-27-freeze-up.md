## Week 7: Mist over the Mackenzie

Huge chunks of ice are flowing down the Mackenzie. The Tsiigenjik River is already frozen over. Only two weeks ago both rivers were open. Imagine you were travelling along the Mackenzie river and still had several day's journey to go. Already, it's only a matter of days before the ferry stops running to our community. The captain says the ice almost doubled overnight, and now he's pushing three inches of ice. In the next few days, the ferry will no longer get close enough to the ferry landing in Tsiigehtchic. When that happens, we go into "isolation."

During most of the year, the main connection we have to other communities is the Dempster highway. In the winter it becomes an ice road, but until the ice is strong enough to drive on, we can not leave our community. We have to wait until someone from Transport Canada makes an official determination that the ice is thick enough to support vehicles. I'm told that some residents will park their car on the far shore before isolation starts, skidoo across the river before it is officially opened, drive their car from the far shore to Inuvik or Fort McPherson. The only other real option is to cross by helicopter.

Many families prepare for isolation by driving up to Inuvik, or Fort McPherson, to buy the food and supplies they'll need to last through three or four weeks. Fresh vegetables will not be easy to access. The Northern Store has been stockpiling supplies for the coming weeks, especially chips and pop. They will receive a weekly helicopter shipment of certain staple food items (eggs, milk, etc.). Our mail will also come in weekly, by helicopter.

Last year, a group of residents were driving back to Tsiigehtchic, and arrived at the ferry crossing just as the river became impassible. The ferry captain tried to get them across. They got part way, but had to turn back. They couldn't break through the shoreline ice. The captain said they would try again the next day, but the same thing happened. They were stranded, on the other side of the partially-frozen Mackenzie River (there really isn't much over there... a house for the Ferry Crew, and repair shop, and that's all). In the end, they had to split the cost of a helicopter to to fly down from Inuvik, and lift them over the river.

### Ski season is on!

Our school has a supply of cross country skiis, and I got my first ski of the season in after school yesterday. It's all downhill from the school, past the Northern Store, and down the road to the ferry landing. I skied down to the shoreline of the Tsiigenjik River. There's an embankment 10 feet back from the river, that drops to a gentle shoreline right down by the water. You can ski along the river at sunset, watching out for stones and the occasional fishing net. Once there's a bit more snow, ski travel will get much easier along here.

Also, here is a personal favourite tea: Yorkshire Orange Pekoe mixed with a pinch of Labrador Tea Leaves, and a few cranberries. I've also heard good things about spruce tea. Apparently it has as much vitamin C as an orange. 

Wishing you a great week ahead!
